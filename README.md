# PMB Filter Implementation

The Poisson Multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter is a probabilistic filtering algorithm used in multi-object tracking scenarios, particularly in the field of target tracking. It's designed to handle situations where the number of objects (targets) and their associations with measurements are uncertain and can vary over time.
