Steps for MB update:
Input: MB, PPP, measurements, radar, obj.

Output: 
	1: Objects might be missed.
	2: Objects are updated.

Process:
A:
   Check if we have any MB to update, if not, return.

B:
   a: 
     Check for the potential objects, we should always have potential objects.

   b: 
     Calculate the likelihood of missing objects

   c:
     DBSCAN

   d: 
     We might have missed an object that overlap with an actual tracked object. So we check for possible new Objects.

   e: 
     loop over the clusters.

   f:
     ggiw update for tracked objects. 

   g:
     Create a cost matrix for each object.

   h:
     Find the k best solution.

   i:
     For the valid solutions, ignore non-essential objects from the cost matrix.

   j:
     Prune MBs wih low weights.

   k: 
     We might have multiple potential objects generated from the same actual object. If so, merge them!

   l:
     remove new objects with low weights.
